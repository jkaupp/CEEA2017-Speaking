# CEEA 2017 Workshop: Speaking with Data
## Jake Kaupp

The slide deck (in pdf form) as well as the 2-page handout for the materials from my talk.

I also wanted to provide some more resources (and tools) for those interested parties that made it this far.

## Resources

One of the best comprehensive lists of resources are the awesome lists on github.  There's one for nearly everything, and the one for data visualization is pretty good.
